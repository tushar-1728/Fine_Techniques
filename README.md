This git contains programs written in C:
1) Solving 8L, 5L, 3L jug problem using state-space-search and back tracking.
2) Becoming bitwise wise and performing sorting of distinct whole numbers in O(n) time complexity.
3) Insertion, deletion, perorder and postorder traversal of persistent binary search tree.
4) Memmory manager using malloc along with book-keeping and it implements best-fit model of memory allocation.
